To run this DNS client, in the command line type:

python mydns.py "domain name" "root DNS IP address"

Where domain name is url of a website and root DNS IP address is a valid root DNS IP address

To make the process that the DNS takes to look up the IP address of the domain name provided easier to follow, the program will request the user to press the Enter key before it queries the next DNS IP for look up.
